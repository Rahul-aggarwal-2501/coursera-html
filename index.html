    <h1 id="heading">The Significance of Colors in the Indian Flag</h1>  
    <div class="col-container">
    <section id = "section1" class="Reciepe">
        <div class= "Box">Saffron</div>
        <p>The upper saffron part of the flag is meant to denote courage and selflessness. It is a religiously significant color to the Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religions as it signifies renunciation and the absolution of the ego. It is the color worn in the spirit of detachment by the wandering renunciants, and it is meant to remind political leadership to conduct their work without seeking material gains, but rather for the good of the nation.</p>

    <section id = "section2" class="Reciepe">
        <div class= "Box">White</div>
        <p>The white stripe in the middle of the flag is representative of honesty, purity and peace. In Indian philosophy white also represents cleanliness and knowledge. It signifies light and the path of truth to guide Indias national conduct. Politically, the white stripe functions as a reminder to Indias leadership that the ultimate national objective is to maintain a state of peace. This is particularly important due to the bloodshed that surrounded Indias independence and subsequent partition.</p>
    </section>
    <section id = "section3" class="Reciepe">
        <div  class= "Box">Green</div>
        <p>The green stipe on the bottom half of the flag represents faith, fertility and prosperity. In Indian philosophy it is considered to be a festive and stabilizing color that represents life and happiness. It demonstrates the value placed on the earth as the ground upon which all life is dependent. In this way the green stripe serves as a reminder to political leaders to protect Indian soil both from external enemies and from internal human destruction.</p>
